This repository contains the Bootstrap CSS and associated JS required for the lecture and the assessed exercises (instructions for assessed exercises are on Moodle).

### Lecture activity 1
Display a webpage called index.html on localhost with the following features:
* ```<title></title>``` (Programming Minor)
* ```<h1></h1>``` Heading (IEP Programming Minor)
* ```<ol></ol>``` Ordered list of 3 modules (Programming, Systems Engineering, Web Development)
* ```<a href=""></a>```Hyperlink Systems Engineering to the Moodle page for this course (https://moodle-1819.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1389)
* ```<img src="" alt="" height="" width="">``` UCL logo as an image (in the img folder if you cloned from GitHub)
* ```<table><tr><td></td></tr></table>``` Table with 2 rows and 2 columns (you can use lorem ipsum as the content for each cell)


### Lecture activity 2
Create a stylesheet called mystyles.css
Add css for each of the elements you created in activity 1


### Lecture activity 3
Modify your index.html to use the bootstrap styles rather than mystyles.css.

Extension: Can you improve the overall structure by applying a grid model to your page?

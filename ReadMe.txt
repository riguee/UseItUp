--- Use It Up ---

--- Setting up the database ---
    Please follow the instructions on this ReadMe file to install and use the UseItUp app.
    Firstly, run the SQL code attached in your local host. This will create the database and populate it. It will also create
a user account with privileges on the UseItUp database. Lastly, as our app functions on a day-to-day basis, with listings
uploaded on the day they are meant to be ordered, the code will also update all the listings to be on the day when you
create the database.

--- Using the app ---
    Please, first login as a restaurant and upload a listing. You can either register a new account and add new values from scratch,
or login using an already existing account. After creating a listing, you can see that the listing appears in the my account page.
Orders (listings that have been ordered) appear in the orders tab. To change the restaurant pickup times of the day, There needs to
be no upcoming listings or order.
    Then, please login as a charity. You can observe that the listing that was created appears in the main listing. You can
order listings from a restaurant and see the order appear in the orders tab. If the order is deleted, the listings will reappear
in the main listing page.
    Please, login as a restaurant again, and you can observe tha the listings that have just been ordered appear in the orders tab.
